            In the summer of 2021, I taught low-income rising 2nd graders in the Bay Area as part of an initiative called The Big Lift, which attempts to minimize education inequalities.
            I facilitated STEM projects, such as building robots, doing science experiments, and taught math.
            Additionally, I allocated resources for the program, to ensure scholars could learn as much as possible, in an attempt to reduce summer learning loss.

            <p>
                Between March 2019 to March 2021, I worked at Peet's Coffee as a Barista. 
                There, I maintained espresso equipment and performed minor repairs to keep coffee machines functioning properly.
                I also ensured that there everyday we served quality espresso and had incredible service.
