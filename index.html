        <p> Hello again! <br><br>
            I'm Hailey Garcia and I'm a first year student at the University of California, Berkeley studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and Business Adminstration through the Managment Entreprenuership, and Technology (M.E.T.) Program. I'm from the Bay Area, and I'm passionate about social justice and I believe that technology can truly elevate communities.         </p>

        <p>
            My family is from Jalisco, Mexico and as a Latina in STEM, I'm passionate about advocating for other underrepresented minorities in tech. After I graduate, I wanted to have a tech company that supports other mujeres like me, and provides mentorship and opportunities to those who haven't had them. I'm a techie at heart, and I love to learn anything new in the field. Even with the barriers I've faced, I've come out strong and even more passionate to change the world.       </p>

        Beyond that, Iâ€™m an environmental activist who absolutely loves dogs (that's Alice on the right). I believe that the way to a successful company is through corporate responsibility and ensuring that you're taking part in making a better tommorow. You'll find me at environmental marches, in climate change classrooms, or the community garden.
